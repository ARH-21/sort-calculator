This is a Python GUI (tkinter library) that allows you to load a text file containing integers to sort based on six algorithms (Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Merge, Quick, Heap). Load the file, click the algorithm button, get the data. It will give the number of moves and comparisons needed to sort the list of integers.

NOTE: The program reads the text files this way:
<pre>
1
28
33
19
</pre>

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-algorithms.git
```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder:**
```bash
cd sorting-algorithms
```

3. **Ensure you have Python 3 installed:**
```bash
python3 --version
```

## Running the Program
Once you are finished, go to the SRC folder and open the Main.py, run the program, it should look like the screenshot. Load your data, enjoy!


## Credit
This project was inspired by Dr. David B. Levine's Sort Detective. In my version, the buttons are listed, so you don't need to figure out which algorithm it is.
