This is a Python GUI (tkinter library) that allows you to load a text file containing integers to sort based on six algorithms (Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Merge, Quick, Heap). Load the file, click the algorithm button, get the data. It will give the number of moves and comparisons needed to sort the list of integers.

NOTE: The program reads the text files this way:
<pre>
1
28
33
19
</pre>


CREDIT: This project was inspired by Dr. David B. Levine's Sort Detective. In my version, the buttons are listed, so you don't need to figure out which algorithm it is.
